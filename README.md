Online Railway Management System Overview

The Online Railway Management System is a digital platform designed to streamline railway operations, enhancing efficiency and user experience. It addresses challenges in traditional railway systems by offering a modern, scalable solution with the following key features:





Ticket Booking: Users can search for trains, select seats, and make secure payments online, with automated confirmations and cancellations.



Train Tracking: Real-time updates on train locations, delays, and statuses via GPS, with notifications sent through email or SMS.



Passenger Management: Handles user profiles, booking history, loyalty programs, and customer support for a personalized experience.



Revenue Management: Tracks ticket sales, promotions, and discounts, generating financial reports to support strategic planning.

Technology Stack

The system leverages modern technologies for a robust and responsive platform:





Frontend: Built with Next.js (React-based) for a dynamic, server-side rendered user interface.



Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express.js to deliver fast, RESTful APIs.



Database: Utilizes MySQL for efficient storage and management of structured data.



Tools: Git (GitHub) for version control, JIRA for project management, and Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.

System Design

The project follows advanced software engineering principles:





Architecture: Employs a client-server model with microservices for scalability and maintainability.



Design: Incorporates Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) with UML diagrams (use cases, sequences, classes) for clear system modeling.



Development Approach: Uses Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum, driven by user stories to ensure iterative progress and adaptability.



Non-Functional Focus: Prioritizes performance, security, usability, and accessibility to deliver a high-quality user experience.

Purpose and Impact

This project serves as an academic showcase of modern web development and software engineering practices. It demonstrates the ability to design and implement a scalable railway management system while addressing real-world operational challenges. The system is a reference for building efficient, user-centric platforms for transportation management.
