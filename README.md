##Project Description

The Online Railway Management System addresses inefficiencies in traditional railway operations through a digital platform with the following features:





Ticket Booking: Enables online train searches, seat selection, and secure payments, with automated confirmations and cancellations.



Train Tracking: Provides real-time train status updates via GPS, including locations, delays, and notifications (email/SMS).



Passenger Management: Manages passenger profiles, booking history, loyalty programs, and customer support channels.



Revenue Management: Tracks ticket sales, promotions, and discounts, generating financial reports for strategic planning.

Technology Stack





Frontend: Next.js (React-based) for a responsive, server-side rendered UI.



Backend: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.



Database: MySQL for structured data storage.



Tools: Git (GitHub) for version control, JIRA for project management, Visual Studio Code as the IDE.

Repository Contents









##Source Code: Located in the repository's directories (e.g., /frontend, /backend, or similar structure). Includes:





##Frontend application built with Next.js.



##Backend APIs developed with Express.js and Node.js.



MySQL database schema and setup scripts (if included).



[Customize this section: Specify folder names or key files, e.g., /src/backend/server.js, /src/frontend/pages/index.js, or database/schema.sql.]

How to Use






##Key sections:





##Chapter 2: Requirements Specification (functional/non-functional requirements, user stories).



##Chapter 3: System Architecture (client-server and microservices).



##Chapter 4: Design Specification (UML diagrams for use cases, sequences, classes).



##Chapter 5: Implementation overview.



##Explore the Source Code:





##Navigate to the source code directories (e.g., /frontend, /backend).



##Review key files for implementation details, such as API endpoints (/backend/api/trains) or frontend components (/frontend/pages/ticket-booking.js).



##[Customize: Add specific file paths or module descriptions if known.]



##Run the Application (if implementing locally):





##Follow the setup instructions below to set up and run the system.

##Setup Instructions

To run the Online Railway Management System locally, follow these steps (based on the planned implementation in the coursework):





##Clone the Repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>



###Install Dependencies:





For the backend:

cd backend  # [Customize: Adjust folder name if different]
npm install



For the frontend:

cd frontend  # [Customize: Adjust folder name if different]
npm install



Configure the Database:





Install MySQL and create a database.



Run the schema scripts (e.g., database/schema.sql) to set up tables like users, trains, bookings, seats, and revenue.



Update the backend configuration (e.g., /backend/config/db.js) with your MySQL credentials:

module.exports = {
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  database: 'railway_system'
};



##Run the Application:





Start the backend server:

cd backend
npm start  # or node server.js [Customize: Adjust command if different]



Start the frontend application:

cd frontend
npm run dev  # Starts Next.js development server



Access the application at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your Next.js setup).



Integrate External Services:





Configure APIs for payment gateways, GPS tracking, and notification services in the backend (e.g., /backend/config/services.js).



[Customize: Specify any external service setup steps if documented in your code.]



##Testing:





Run unit and integration tests (if included, e.g., npm test in /backend or /frontend).



Refer to Section 8 of the coursework document for testing strategies.

##Purpose

This project demonstrates advanced software engineering practices, including:





Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) with UML diagrams.



Agile development using Scrum, driven by user stories.



Modern web development with a scalable client-server and microservices architecture.



Emphasis on non-functional requirements like performance, security, usability, and accessibility.

The repository serves as an academic submission and a reference for designing scalable railway management systems.

##Notes





The source code is included but may require configuration for local execution (e.g., environment variables, external service keys).



Ensure the repository's visibility (public/private) complies with academic guidelines to prevent unintended sharing.



[Customize: Add any specific notes, e.g., known issues, missing dependencies, or deployment status.]

##Future Improvements





Enhance real-time train tracking with WebSocket integration.



Implement advanced analytics for revenue management.



Add support for additional payment gateways and multi-currency transactions.



Refer to Section 12 of the coursework document for detailed future work plans.
